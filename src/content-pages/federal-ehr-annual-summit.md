# Federal EHR Annual Summit

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office brings together clinical staff from the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),  Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with community providers and other leading clinical experts to assess the use of the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR). The discussions focus on opportunities for enhancing the Federal EHR to better serve Service members, Veterans, and other beneficiaries. Participants hear from federal leaders and experts, earn continuing education units, network with peers, and share their experiences to enhance patient care.

Nearly 1,800 participants registered for this year’s summit, scheduled virtually from Tuesday, October 22, to Thursday, October 24, which was intended for clinical staff at DOD, VA, USCG, and NOAA sites who used the Federal EHR for four months or more. The FEHRM will share the 2024 Federal Electronic Health Record Summit: End-User Feedback Executive Summary when available.
