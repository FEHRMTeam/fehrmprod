# Federal EHR Annual Summit

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office brings together clinical staff from the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with community providers and other leading clinical experts to assess the use of the federal electronic health record (EHR). The discussions focus on opportunities for enhancing the federal EHR to better serve our Service members, Veterans and other beneficiaries. Participants hear from federal leaders and experts, earn continuing medical education credits, network with peers and share their experiences to enhance patient care.

This year’s summit is scheduled virtually from Tuesday, October 24 to Thursday, October 26, 2023. [Register Today](https://registration.socio.events/e/federalehrannualsummit2023)!
