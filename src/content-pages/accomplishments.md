See below a snapshot of additional notable accomplishments as well as these [success stories](/success-stories) related to the Federal EHR.

- Established the FEHRM, finalized its charter and selected permanent leadership—while operationalizing the FEHRM’s mission to deliver common capabilities that enhance health care and enable the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to implement a single, common Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR)
- Led value-added activities for DOD, VA, USCG, and NOAA EHR deployments—for example, executed the Enterprise Operations Center during recent deployments to provide actionable executive-level insight into information technology production events
- Launched and expanded the joint health information exchange, connecting DOD, VA, USCG, and NOAA providers with more than 61,000 external provider sites and more than 90% of community hospitals across the United States, allowing clinicians to quickly and securely access patient electronic health information, enhancing clinical decision-making
