The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office will present and exhibit at the [2024 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium (DHITS)](https://www.dhadhits.com/event/37324254-fd27-44d2-a2f2-eac3bc6304e6/summary) from August 20 to 22 in Dallas, Texas. 

## Presentations

### Plenary – The Federal EHR: What’s Next

**Thursday, August 22, 2:00 to 3:00pm | Landmark Ballroom, Hyatt
Regency Dallas**

_Mr. Bill Tinston, FEHRM Director; Dr. Yvette Weber, Program Executive Officer, Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems, Department of Defense (DOD); and Dr. Neil Evans, Acting Program Executive Director, Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); and Ms. Cori Hughes (moderator), FEHRM Program Integration Director_

The federal electronic health record (EHR) is deployed to all DOD health
care sites and the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (Lovell
FHCC)─the most complex joint sharing site involving DOD and VA. So, what’s
next? The FEHRM works with DOD, VA, the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to continue deploying the single, common federal EHR across federal health care sites. This effort enhances patient care and provider effectiveness, wherever care is provided. This session’s panel of FEHRM, DOD, and VA leaders will talk about this federal journey toward EHR modernization, including how the federal sector drives change across the health care enterprise, the importance of interoperability, and how the federal EHR
enhances the health care experience of providers and patients across the
country.

### Breakout Session – Interface Development within the MHS Information Portal

**Tuesday, August 20, 3:15 to 4:15pm | Reunion BC, Hyatt Regency
Dallas**

_Mr. John Dempsey, FEHRM Partner Integration Director_

During this session, Mr. Dempsey and DOD leaders will define several Military Health System Information Platform (MIP) application programming interfaces (APIs) in use and why they are mapped to the Common Data Model, elaborate on how the MIP APIs change the way the MIP serves data, explain the historical background of the API development effort, elaborate on the importance of Common Data Model normalized datasets to the MIP API strategy, and discuss the direction of MIP health surveillance and what is to come.

### Breakout Session – Remove Barriers, Build One Truth: Unified Incident Reporting

**Wednesday, August 21, 12:30 to 1:30pm | Reunion BC, Hyatt Regency
Dallas**

_Mr. Lance Scott, FEHRM Chief Technology Officer; Dr. Valerie Seabaugh, FEHRM Acting Deputy Chief Health Informatics Officer; and Ms. Kim Hranowsky (moderator), FEHRM Deputy Chief Technology Officer_

As DOD and VA move onto a single federal EHR, cross-departmental communication becomes essential. This session opens with the challenges to how incidents are tracked, triaged, and communicated (e.g., service interruptions at Lovell FHCC); discusses the current support measures put into place (e.g., code upgrades, cloud hosting); and closes with the desired future end state to create a single record of truth for system performance.

### Breakout Session – Federal EHR Advancements in Population Health

**Wednesday, August 21, 2:00 to 3:00pm | Reunion A, Hyatt Regency
Dallas**

_Ms. Crystal Baum, FEHRM Data Exchange Director_ 

In this session, Ms. Baum will discuss federal Departments' activities in advancing population health management using the HealtheIntent platform. She will highlight HealtheRegistries and its ability to identify gaps in patient care and how HealtheAnalytics provides aggregation of data to offer different levels of reporting. She will also explain in further detail how HealtheRecord provides a complete view of the longitudinal record.
