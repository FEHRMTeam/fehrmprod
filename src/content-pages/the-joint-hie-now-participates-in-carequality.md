**The Joint HIE Now Participates in Carequality**

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office expanded
its joint health information exchange (HIE) in August 2023 to include participating in Carequality, a framework enabling health data sharing between and among
networks. The joint HIE is a secure gateway used to connect to participating
provider organizations across the United States who agree to securely share
clinical information with the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 

Participating in Carequality significantly expands the percentage of U.S. hospitals connected to the joint HIE from 75% to more than 90%—enhancing
the ability to exchange patient data and resulting in more informed care for
patients navigating between different health care systems and providers. The
joint HIE is part of the FEHRM’s overarching effort to deliver capabilities
that enable the Departments to deploy a single, common federal EHR. With this
connection, DOD, VA, USCG and NOAA clinicians, nurses and administrators gain
access to an expanded set of external health records from participating
provider organizations for patients. Other organizations previously unable to
query these Departments can now retrieve data from them.
