Participating in Carequality significantly expands the percentage of U.S. hospitals connected to the joint HIE from 75% to more than 90%—enhancing
the ability to exchange patient data and resulting in more informed care for
patients navigating between different health care systems and providers. The
joint HIE is part of the FEHRM’s overarching effort to deliver capabilities
that enable the Departments to deploy a single, common federal EHR. With this
connection, DOD, VA, USCG and NOAA clinicians, nurses and administrators gain
access to an expanded set of external health records from participating
provider organizations for patients. Other organizations previously unable to
query these Departments can now retrieve data from them.
