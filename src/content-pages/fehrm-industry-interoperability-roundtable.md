# The State of the Federal EHR

The State of the Federal EHR took place on September 24, from noon to 2 p.m. ET.

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosted this biannual event to discuss the current and future state of the Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR), health information technology, and health information exchange. The event highlights the progress made in implementing a single, common Federal EHR and related capabilities across the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other federal agencies.

This event was virtual via Microsoft Teams and open to the public. The FEHRM invited active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience.
