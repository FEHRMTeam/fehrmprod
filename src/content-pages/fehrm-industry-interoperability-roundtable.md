# FEHRM Industry Roundtable – June 7, 2023

On June 7, 2023, from 12:00PM to 2:00PM ET, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office will host the 14th FEHRM Industry Roundtable. Twice a year, the FEHRM hosts this roundtable to discuss the current and future state of health information technology and health information exchange. The roundtable also highlights the progress of the FEHRM, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in collaborating with external partners to implement the single, common federal EHR and related capabilities.  

The theme for the June roundtable is “Implementation Successes.” The roundtable will feature updates from FEHRM, DOD, VA and USCG leaders on their federal EHR efforts as well as interactive discussion panels focused on success stories related to implementing the federal EHR and exchanging health data to enhance the delivery of health care for Service members, Veterans and other beneficiaries. 

This virtual event is available through Microsoft Teams and open to the public. The FEHRM invites active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience.

The link to register for the event is forthcoming.
