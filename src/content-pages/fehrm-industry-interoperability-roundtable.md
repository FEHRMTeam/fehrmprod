# FEHRM Industry Roundtable – June 7, 2023

On June 7, 2023, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosted the 14th FEHRM Industry Roundtable. Twice a year, the FEHRM hosts this roundtable to discuss the current and future state of the federal electronic health record (EHR), health information technology and health information exchange. The roundtable also highlights the progress of the FEHRM, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in collaborating with external partners to implement the single, common federal EHR and related capabilities.

The theme for the June roundtable was “Implementation Successes.” The roundtable featured updates from FEHRM, DOD, VA and USCG leaders on their federal EHR efforts. The event offered interactive discussion panels with site leaders on their successful experiences implementing and using the federal EHR and with federal agencies on their progress with exchanging health data to enhance the delivery of health care for Service members, Veterans and other beneficiaries.

This virtual event was available through Microsoft Teams and open to the public. The FEHRM invited active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience.
