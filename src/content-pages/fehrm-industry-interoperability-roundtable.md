# The State of the Federal EHR

On November 14, 2023, from 12 to 2 p.m. ET, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office will host The State of the Federal EHR (the 15th meeting, formerly known as the FEHRM Industry Roundtable). This event is held twice a year to discuss the current and future state of the federal electronic health record (EHR), health information technology and health information exchange. It will also highlight the progress of the FEHRM, Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to implement a single, common federal EHR and related capabilities.

The theme for the November event is “Achieving Data-Driven Outcomes in the Federal EHR.” The meeting will feature updates from FEHRM, DOD, VA, USCG and NOAA leaders on their federal EHR efforts as well as an interactive discussion panel focused on data-driven insights to enhance the delivery of health care for Service members, Veterans and other beneficiaries.

This event will be virtual via Microsoft Teams and is open to the public. We invite active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience. Additional details regarding the agenda and event will be distributed to registered participants prior to the event.

If you have any questions about this event, please send an email to FEHRMcommunications@va.gov and include “The State of the Federal EHR” in the subject line.
