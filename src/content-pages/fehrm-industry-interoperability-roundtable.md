# The State of the Federal EHR

Plan to attend the State of the Federal EHR on September 24, from noon to          2 p.m. ET.

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office will host this biannual event to discuss the current and future state of the federal electronic health record (EHR), health information technology, and health information exchange. The event highlights the progress made in implementing a single, common federal EHR and related capabilities across the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other federal agencies.

This event will be virtual via Microsoft Teams and open to the public. We invite active participation from individuals who possess relevant broad-based knowledge and experience. Additional details regarding the agenda and meeting will be distributed to registered participants prior to the event.

If you have any questions about this event, please send an email to [FEHRMcommunications@va.gov](mailto:FEHRMcommunications@va.gov) and include “The State of the Federal EHR” in the subject line.
