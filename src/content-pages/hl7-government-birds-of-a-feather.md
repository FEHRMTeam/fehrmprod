# HL7 Government Birds of a Feather

The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization (FEHRM) office hosts the only Government Health Level Seven International (HL7) affinity group meeting
(“Birds of a Feather”) in conjunction with HL7 Working Group meetings that
takes place three times annually.  

**The next HL7 Government Birds of a Feather meeting is on Wednesday, January 31, 2024, from 1:30 to 3 p.m. UTC (8:30 to 10 a.m. ET)** during
the Health Level Seven® International (HL7®) Group Meeting held from January
29 to February 2, 2024. The Birds of Feather forum strategically promotes
national standards and interoperability policies. This forum is considered the
voice of the public sector at HL7 to promote national policies for standards
and interoperability.  

The FEHRM organized this event to facilitate, promote and collaborate on
interoperability.  Speakers include the FEHRM, Department of Veteran
Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Indian Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
