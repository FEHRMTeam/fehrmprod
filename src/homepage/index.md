  taglineDescription: <p> The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization
    (FEHRM) office works within the federal space to implement a single, common
    federal electronic health record (EHR) that enhances patient care and
    provider effectiveness. An EHR is software that's used to securely document,
    store, retrieve, share and analyze information about individual patient
    care. It enables a digital version of a patient record. <p>The FEHRM <a
    href="/about-fehrm">unites efforts and delivers common capabilities</a> that
    enable the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),
    Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Department of
    Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other
    federal agencies to deploy the same federal EHR. Common capabilities refer
    to common solutions, tools and activities needed to effectively implement
    the federal EHR and ensure meaningful data sharing between the federal EHR
    and community providers. </p> <p> The federal EHR helps health care systems
    within the federal space and beyond effectively deliver health care and
    benefits by bringing a common record to patients and providers. There is <a
    href="/success-stories"> recognition across the board </a> that the federal
    EHR saves providers time and enables more standard workflows to support
    enhanced clinical decision-making and patient safety.</p> <p>As of today,
    there are more than 194,000 DOD, VA and USCG federal EHR users‚Äîsuch as
    doctors and nurses‚Äîat 135 parent military treatment facilities, five VA
    medical centers, 109 USCG sites and seven NOAA sites. More than 9.5 million
    unique patients are in the federal EHR system.</p>
