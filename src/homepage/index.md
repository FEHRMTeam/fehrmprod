  taglineDescription: <p> The Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization
    (FEHRM) office works within the federal space to implement a single, common
    Federal Electronic Health Record (EHR) that enhances patient care and
    provider effectiveness. An EHR is software that is used to securely
    document, store, retrieve, share, and analyze information about individual
    patient care. It enables a digital version of a patient record. <p>The FEHRM
    <a href="/about-fehrm">unites efforts and delivers common capabilities</a>
    that enable the Department of War (DOW), Department of Veterans Affairs
    (VA), Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Department
    of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and
    other federal agencies to deploy the same Federal EHR. Common capabilities
    refer to common solutions, tools, and activities needed to effectively
    implement the Federal EHR and ensure meaningful data sharing between the
    Federal EHR and community providers. </p> <p> The Federal EHR helps health
    care systems within the federal space and beyond effectively deliver health
    care and benefits by bringing a common record to patients and providers.
    There is <a href="/success-stories"> recognition across the board </a> that
    the Federal EHR saves providers time and enables more standard workflows to
    support enhanced clinical decision-making and patient safety.</p> <p>As of
    today, there are more than 207,000 DOW, VA, USCG, and NOAA Federal EHR
    users, such as doctors and nurses; 138 parent military treatment facilities;
    six VA medical centers; 110 USCG sites, and seven NOAA sites. More than 8.5
    million unique patients are in the Federal EHR system.</p>
